TEST_SHADE [<options>]

Test RENDlib shading.  All of the standard RENDlib test program command
line options are legal, although they may not all be obeyed.  In
addition, TEST_SHADE can take the following private command line
options:

  -EMIS weight
  -DIFF weight
  -SPEC weight

       Set the weighting factor for the emissive, diffuse, and specular
       surface properties, respectively.  If the weighting factor is
       exactly zero, then that surface property is shut off.

  -SPEXP exp

       Set the specular exponent.  The default is 15.

  -OPAC front side

       Set object opacity fraction.  Opacity of 0 is totally
       transparent, and 1 is totally opaque.  The FRONT value applies
       when the object surface is directly facing the eye point.  The
       SIDE value applies when it is facing at right angle to the eye
       point.  intermediate angles are interpolated appropriately.  The
       default is -OPAC 1 1 (everything totally opaque).

       NOTE:  The object polygons are not sorted, so transparent
       objects will not be drawn correctly with Z buffering.  The -OPAC
       option is intended to test the ray tracer variable
       transparency.

  -ROD

       Draw a rod piercing the sphere.  The rod will always be drawn
       using Z buffering, even if the -RAY command line option is
       specified.  This is intended to test Z correspondance bewteen
       the ray tracer and the Z buffer renderer.

  -RAY_ROD

       Draw the rod using ray tracing.  This option implies -ROD.  The
       default is to draw the rod using Z buffering, even when -RAY is
       specified.
