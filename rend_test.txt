            Common RENDlib Test Program Command Line Options
                            24 October 2004

Many of the test programs that exercise RENDlib permit a common set of
command line options.  Each program may also have additional command
line options.  The common RENDlib test program command line options are
documented here.  While all command line options are legal for programs
that claim to use the RENDlib test program command line options, many
programs ignore some of the options.

RENDlib test programs are not intended for general use by customers.
Some are included in software releases because they may help us
diagnose problems at your site.  They may also help more advanced users
verify the installation of new hardware, software, etc.

WARNING: Although some aspects of some of the RENDlib test programs are
  documented in a general software release, all such programs are
  unsupported.  Not all features are documented or explained fully.
  Features may change incompatibly without warning at any time.

The command line options are:

  -DEV <RENDlib device specifier string>

       See the RENDLIB_DEV documentation file for more info.

  -IMG

       Write the result of the drawing to an image file.  Currently,
       this forces software emulation.  The generic image file name
       will be the program name.

  -INAME <image file name>

       Same as -IMG, above, except that the image file name is given
       explicitly.

  -SW

       Forces software emulation regardless of whether it is really
       necessary for correct drawing.  The default is to only force
       software emulation when necessary.

  -SIZE ix iy

       Declare desired image size in pixels.  The requested size may
       not be possible if also drawing to hardware.  The default size
       is the size of the hardware draw area in use, if any.  Otherwise
       the default is 512 x 410.

  -LIGHT_EXACT

       Require that the RENDlib lighting model be followed exactly.
       The default is to allow small errors if speedups are available
       on the current device.

  -BIT_VIS n

       Request a minimum effective visible color resolution in
       bits/pixel.  The default varies from program to program.  For
       most programs, the default is either the maximum of mimimum
       color resolution available.

  -ASPECT width height

       Specify the whole image aspect ratio.  This may have no effect
       on some output devices.  The default is to assume square
       pixels.

  -RAY

       Request ray tracing.

  -CIRRES n
  -CIRRES1 n
  -CIRRES2 n

       Set the number of line segments to be used to approximate a
       circle.  CIRRES 1 and 2 are used for major and minor angle
       parameters, such as would exist when drawing a torus.  -CIRRES
       sets both these to the same value.  This value must be an
       integer no less than 4.  The default is 20.

  -WIRE

       Request wire frame rendering.

  -THICK t

       Set the wire frame vector thickness.  The thickness parameter is
       in units of pixels for an image which has 512 as its minimum
       dimension.  Therefore, if T is set to 1.5, then vectors will be
       3 pixels wide on a 1280 x 1024 image.  The thickness does not
       actually kick in unless the resulting thickness is at least two
       pixels.  The default is T = 1.0.

  -FACET

       Request facet shading.  Shading normals come directly from
       geometric normals.  The default is linear (Gouraud) shading.

  -FLAT

       Request flat shading.  Color value is constant accross each
       polygon.  The default is linear (Gouraud) shading.

  -NPERSP

       Turn perspective OFF.  The default is perspective is ON.

  -SUBPIXV

       Request that vectors be drawn using subpixel addressing.

  -NSUBPIXP

       Request that polygons be drawn without subpixel addressing.

  -UDPATE <update mode>

       Indicate the desired display update mode.  The update mode name
       must be one of the following:

         LIVE  -  The display will be updated often enough for drawing
              to appear "live".

         BUFFALL  -  RENDlib may buffer updates to the display if this
              increase overall speed.

  -COM <comment string>

       Define a comment string.  It is up to each program what to do
       with this string.  Programs that use this feature will generally
       write the comment string to the image.  All the comments are
       also normally written as comment lines to image files that
       support this feature.  Any number of -COM command line arguments
       may be given.  Each -COM adds one line to the bottom of the
       comment lines.

  -XF2D xbx xby  ybx yby  ofsx ofsy

       Set initial 2D transform.

  -ROTX a
  -ROTY a
  -ROTZ a

       Perform incremental rotation about the selected axis.  The angle
       values are in units of half circles.  A value of 0.5 therefore
       results in a PI/2 rotation.

       The incremental transform specified by this option is
       post-multiplied by the 3D transform accumulated so far.  The
       result becomes the new 3D transform.  The 3D transform is
       initialized to identity before any command line options are
       processed.

  -OFS3D dx dy dz

       Offset the 3D model space origin.

       The incremental transform specified by this option is
       post-multiplied by the 3D transform accumulated so far.  The
       result becomes the new 3D transform.  The 3D transform is
       initialized to identity before any command line options are
       processed.

  -SCALE3D m

       Uniformly scale the 3D model space.

       The incremental transform specified by this option is
       post-multiplied by the 3D transform accumulated so far.  The
       result becomes the new 3D transform.  The 3D transform is
       initialized to identity before any command line options are
       processed.

  -XF3D  XBx XBy XBz  YBx YBy YBz  ZBx ZBy ZBz  DIx DIy DIz

       Define a complete relative 3D transformation.

       The incremental transform specified by this option is
       post-multiplied by the 3D transform accumulated so far.  The
       result becomes the new 3D transform.  The 3D transform is
       initialized to identity before any command line options are
       processed.

  -EYEDIS e

       Set eye distance perspective factor.  Default is the "normal"
       value of 3.3333.  Smaller values result in more extreme
       perspective.

  -AA n

       Set anti-aliasing subpixel factor.  Value of 1 disables
       anti-aliasing, which is also the default.  WARNING: Enabling
       anti-aliasing can seriously confuse programs not explicitly
       intended to handle it.

  -TMAP <name>

       Explicitly specify the texture map image file name.  The default
       is images/tmap/default withing the software installation
       directory.

  -TMAP_EXACT

       Require that the RENDlib texture mapping model be followed
       exactly.  By default, small errors are allowed if this increases
       performance on the current device.

  -TFILT <subcommand>

       Control the various texture mapping filtering switches.  The
       subcommands are:

         MAP  -  Filter between adjacent size maps.

         NMAP  -  Disable filtering between maps.

         PIX  -  Filter between nearest pixels within each texture
              map.  Bi-linear interpolation is used.

         NPIX  -  Disable filtering between pixels in the same map.

       The default is MAP and NPIX.  Note that no interpolation may be
       performed, or not performed as described unless -TMAP_EXACT is
       specified.

  -MAXMAP n
  -MINMAP n

       Set the min and max filtered texture map sizes to use.  The N
       value is the Log2 of the number of pixels in each dimension.
       The default is 0 to 13, meaning maps from 1 x 1 to 8192 x 8192
       pixels in size may be used.  The values specified will be
       clipped to the available sizes in whatever texture map is used.

  -OLDSPHERE

       Set sphere drawing compatible with software prior to 29 January
       1997.  A sphere primitive is now built directly into RENDlib,
       and can be ray traced as one whole sphere.  Previously, the
       REND_TEST_SPHERE routine tesselated a sphere itself.  Such
       spheres were ray traced as a collection of triangles.  The
       tesselation method also differs between the old REND_TEST_SPHERE
       routine and the new RENDlib sphere primitive.

       The reason for this command line option is for compatibility
       with old benchmark results.  Any benchmark test that draws
       spheres will do different work between the old and new
       versions.  The -OLDSPHERE command line option allows these
       benchmark tests to be run on software released on or after 29
       January 1997, while still providing meaningful comparisons with
       old benchmark results.
